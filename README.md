Thanks for checking out this project!
This repository contains the **full implementation of Parallax Occlusion Mapping with Self-Shadowing**, written in HLSL for Unity's Built-in Render Pipeline.

If you're looking for an in-depth explanation of how it all works â€” from tangent space setup to steep parallax and self-shadowing â€” Iâ€™ve written a full walkthrough on my website:

ðŸ‘‰ **Read the tutorial here**:
[Parallax Mapping with Self-Shadowing](https://bentobaux.github.io/posts/parallax-mapping-with-self-shadowing/)

The tutorial is beginner-friendly and focuses on helping you truly understand why parallax mapping works â€” not just how to plug it in.
Whether you're learning shaders or improving your technical art skills, I hope it helps you as much as writing it helped me.
